A dataset was imported from Kaggle, and Python libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib were utilized for data engineering and analysis. A linear regression model was then developed to predict housing prices based on this data.

Next, A Python Flask server was created to integrate the trained model, allowing it to handle HTTP requests. The server then processed incoming requests and generates housing price predictions.

Finally,  UI was designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This interface allowed users to input details such as suburb, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, garage spaces, land area, and floor area. The frontend then communicated this information to the Flask server, which returned and displayed the predicted housing price.
